archi3d/urls.py — Root URL Configuration
=========================================

This file defines the top-level URL routing for the entire Django project.
Each "include()" delegates to a specific app's urls.py.

URL STRUCTURE:
  /admin/              → Django Admin UI (create superuser first)
  /api/v1/design/      → Design pipeline endpoints (POST, GET)
  /api/v1/health/      → Health check endpoint (GET)

HOW ROUTING WORKS:
  1. Django reads this file on every request
  2. It matches the URL path against each urlpattern in order
  3. The first match wins and control passes to the included urls.py
  4. If no match: 404 Not Found

ADDING NEW URL GROUPS:
  - Create a new app with its own urls.py
  - Add it here:  path("api/v1/newapp/", include("apps.newapp.urls"))
